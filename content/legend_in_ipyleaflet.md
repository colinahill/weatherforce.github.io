# A legend for ipyleaflet

![image](/images/map_legend.png)

In a previous blog post, we announced the release of [ipyleaflet-legend](http://tech.weatherforce.org/blog/ipyleaflet-legend-release/). Soon after the release, Something unexpected happened! An issue was filled on our repository from ipyleaflet maintainer [martinRenou](https://github.com/martinRenou)!Martin asked if we were willing to put the code directly in ipyleaflet code base. We were, and we did! It is now released and available as LegendControl, within ipyleaflet🎉. Do not hesitate to try it out, [here is an example](https://ipyleaflet.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api_reference/legend_control.html)

We are very proud to have contributed to [ipyleaflet](https://ipyleaflet.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), and we would like to thanks Martin and the ipyleaflet team for the opportunity of doing so.👍
